## What happened

On May 29, 2026 — **one day after Judge Carl Nichols declined to block EO 14399** — the U.S. Postal Service filed a Federal Register notice (Docket 2026-10968; published June 2, 2026, 91 FR 32915) initiating proposed rulemaking to implement the EO's mail-ballot provisions. Postmaster General **David Steiner** signed off; he had previously "met with other senior Trump administration and DOJ officials to discuss ways to implement the order" (Democracy Docket, May 29, 2026) — the public record of inter-agency coordination on the implementation mechanism.

## The mechanism

The proposed rule requires:

1. **State submission of voter lists**: State election officials must transmit lists of mail-ballot requesters to USPS **at least 30 days before ballots are sent**. "Supplemental submissions" are permitted until the last ballot mailing day.
2. **Voters off the list don't receive ballots**: Voters whose names are not on the USPS-held list will not receive their mail ballots. USPS expressly stated it "would not verify whether individuals should or should not be included" on the lists — meaning the verification has already happened upstream (via DHS State Citizenship Lists built against the SAVE database) before USPS even sees the data.
3. **Unique barcodes**: Each mail ballot envelope would carry a unique barcode tying it to the federal list entry, enabling per-ballot tracking and rejection.
4. **Expansion of USPS role**: USPS would move from mail-delivery vendor to "assessing ballot validity, finalizing voter lists, tracking ballots, and designing ballot envelopes" (Cato).

The proposed rule excludes primary elections and UOCAVA (military/overseas) voters, suggesting the architects know the constitutional vulnerability is sharpest on the general-election mail-ballot population.

## Timeline pressure on 2026 midterms

- **Comment period**: 30 days from publication → closes approximately **June 28, 2026**.
- **Final rule deadline under EO 14399**: 120 days from March 31 → approximately **July 29, 2026**.
- **State mail-ballot transmission**: many states mail ballots 60 days before Election Day → early September 2026.

The window between final rule and ballot transmission is **roughly 30 days**. As Stephen Richer (Cato) noted, the existing election-mail infrastructure took years to develop; the proposed rule contemplates standing up a new verification-list architecture in five weeks. The brittleness is the point: an unworkable system that nevertheless has legal authority to refuse delivery is a system that produces refused ballots.

## SAVE database coordination

The Democracy Docket reporting notes the rule's voter lists "would rely on Department of Homeland Security databases" — DHS's SAVE database is the verification engine. DHS itself quietly revised SAVE's accuracy from 99% (2024) to 97% (May 2026 disclosure to the Washington Times). At 97% accuracy on the scale of the U.S. voter file (~200M+ registered voters), the false-positive count flagging eligible citizens as noncitizens runs into the millions. Documented historical false-positive rates from state pilot programs:

- **Alabama** (pre-2024): inactivated 3,251 voters via SAVE cross-check; at least 2,074 later confirmed as eligible citizens.
- **Boone County, KY**: more than half of flagged "noncitizen" voters were citizens.
- **Texas (Texas Tribune, Feb 2026)**: SAVE flagged eligible voters as noncitizens, requiring re-affirmation.

## Coordination signal

The Steiner-DOJ coordination meeting referenced in Democracy Docket is the **named-conductor evidence** linking the three threads: USPS rulemaking, DOJ voter-roll litigation, and DHS citizenship-list construction are not independent agency actions but **coordinated implementation of a single Presidential directive (EO 14399) with an inter-agency steering process**. Whether the coordination architect is named in the White House, DOJ Civil Rights Division ([[dhillon-harmeet|Harmeet Dhillon]]), or via Susie Wiles / Stephen Miller's policy shop is a near-term research gap.

## Connections

- Day-after-Nichols-ruling timing: the [[2026-05-28--nichols-declines-block-trump-mail-ballot-eo-dscc-naacp-lulac-consolidated|Nichols ruling]] removed the immediate legal obstacle; USPS proceeded.
- Parallel DOJ Civil Rights Division litigation against 30 states for voter-roll access (covered in [[election-system-capture-2026|the election-system-capture-2026 theme]]) provides the upstream voter-data flow.
- Mechanism connects to the [[ziklag-operation-checkmate-coordinated-voter-roll-challenge-apparatus|Ziklag voter-roll-challenge apparatus]] (private-sector parallel) — both produce systemic disqualification of likely-Democratic voters.

## Research gaps

- Full Federal Register citation (volume/page) of Docket 2026-10968 once final published.
- Whether the inter-agency steering for EO 14399 implementation runs through a named White House office (DPC, OMB OIRA, Stephen Miller's shop).
- Whether USPS career or political-appointee staff signed the proposed rule.
